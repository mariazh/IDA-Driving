<p>
    State law requires students to be at least 15 years of age before the first classroom session.
    A parent information session will typically be held on the second week of class or will be
    scheduled outside of regular classroom hours. The instructor will go over the basics of the
    course and what to expect. We strongly encourage a parent or guardian to observe at least
    one driving lesson. 
</p>

<p>
    The minimum course length is 5 weeks and all course requirements must be completed within
    3 months. Driving lessons are held outside of classroom meeting times and will extend beyond
    the classroom portion of the course. Lessons usually takes place every 1 to 2 weeks starting
    the second week of class.
