<h2>AFTER ROAD TEST</h2>

<p>
    Exam scores will be entered onto the DOL database within 24 hours. Applicants must pass
    the Knowledge and Driving Test with a minimum score of 80% on each test respectively.
    After you pass, visit your local DOL office to apply for a drivers license. <br><br>

        *Passing the Driving Test does not guarantee an applicant will be issued a drivers license. 
    </span><br><br>
    
    If you received a letter from DOL due to physical, mental, visual, or medical issue, you must
    take the Driving Test at a DOL office. Failure to disclose this information prior to testing
    will result in your test not being honored at DOL and no refunds will be issued.<br><br>
    
    Pursuant to RCW 46.20.720, a driver convicted of an alcohol offense may be required to have
    an ignition interlock device (IID). The applicant must take the skills exam in the vehicle using the IID.
