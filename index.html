    “Hello! My name is Joyce and I’ve been a driving instructor and examiner for more than ten years. Over the decade,
    I’ve taught many students, from new drivers to experienced. I strongly believe a student’s driving skills largely
    depend on the quality of the teaching. As the instructor, I always strive to do my best and will treat you with my
    utmost respect & patience when behind the wheel."

    Why Choose IDA?
</h1>
<p>
    At IDA, our main goal is to produce skillful drivers who are also equipped to drive defensively.
    We aim to mirror real world scenarios so that once students graduate from our school, they will
    immediately be able to drive safely and confidently on the road. 
</p>
<p>
    What differentiates us from other driving schools is our unique–<span class="color-red">same instructor, one-to-one sessions.</span>
    The benefits of having one-to-one sessions with the same teacher is the personalized lessons for
    each student. Personalized lessons will enable the students’ instructor to know their weaknesses
    and strengths. That way, every driving lesson can be geared towards fortifying students’ weak points. 
</p>
<p>
    Another differentiation exclusive to IDA is the <span class="color-red">optional observation hours</span> that come with its
    driving packages. Observational learning, although optional, is actually quite helpful. Students
    can observe other drivers who are similar in level to not only ease their nervousness but also pick
    up on common mistakes. This way, students can prevent themselves from performing the same errors
    which therefore contribute to the improvement of their driving. 
</p>
<p>
    If you’re looking for a patient, knowledgeable, caring, and humorous instructor, then IDA is
    the way to go. Don’t hesitate to contact us to schedule your driving lesson or test. I look
    forward to seeing you!
