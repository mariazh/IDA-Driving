    “<strong id="hello">Hello!</strong> My name is Joyce and I’ve been a driving instructor and examiner for more than ten years.
    Over the decade, I’ve taught many students, from new drivers to experienced. I strongly believe
    a student’s driving skills largely depend on the quality of the teaching. As the instructor,
    I always strive to do my best and will treat you with my utmost respect and patience when behind
    the wheel."

    WHY CHOOSE IDA?
</h1>

<p>
    At IDA, our main goal is to produce skillful drivers who are also equipped to drive defensively.
    We aim to mirror real-world scenarios so that once students graduate from our school, they will
    immediately be able to drive safely and confidently on the road without feeling unprepared. 
</p>

<p>
    What differentiates us from other driving schools is our unique–<span class="color-red">same instructor, one-to-one sessions.</span>
    The benefits of having one-to-one sessions with the same teacher are personalized lessons for each
    student. Personalized lessons will enable the student’s instructor to know their weaknesses and
    strengths. That way, driving lessons can be geared towards fortifying students’ weak points while
    at the same time, practice all the necessary skills to become defensive and responsible drivers. 
</p>

<p>
    Exclusively at IDA is the <span class="color-red">optional observation hours</span> that come with its adult driving packages.
    Observational learning, although optional, is quite helpful. Students can observe other drivers
    who are similar in level to not only ease their nervousness but also pick up on common mistakes.
    This way, students can prevent themselves from performing the same errors which therefore
    contribute to the improvement of their driving. 
</p>

<p>
    If you’re looking for a patient, knowledgeable, and caring instructor, then IDA is
    the way to go. Don’t hesitate to contact us to schedule your driving lesson or test. I look
    forward to seeing you!
